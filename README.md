# 3D U-Net Model Project

## Overview
This README provides essential information about the utilities, dataset handling, and training scheme for the 3D U-Net model. The project is structured into several Python scripts, each serving specific functions in the overall implementation of the 3D U-Net model for volumetric segmentation.

## Utilities
The project includes various utility scripts that aid in data handling, preprocessing, and model evaluation. These utilities are crucial for efficient and effective management of the model's workflow.

### File Descriptions
- `Read_CSV.py`: Handles the reading and processing of CSV files related to the dataset.
- `criteria.py`: Contains different criteria or loss functions for model evaluation.
- `imgproc.py`: Dedicated to image processing tasks, including normalization and augmentation.
- `utils.py`: Provides general-purpose utility functions for the project.

## Dataset Handling (`dataset.py`)
This script manages the dataset, offering functionality for loading, preprocessing, and augmenting the data.

### Key Components
- **TrainValidImageDataset**: Loads and processes training and validation datasets, supporting data augmentation and preprocessing steps.
- **TestDataset**: Similar to `TrainValidImageDataset`, but tailored for handling the test dataset.
- **PrefetchDataLoader**: Enhances data loading efficiency through data prefetching.
- **CPUPrefetcher and CUDAPrefetcher**: Optimizes data transfer between CPU and GPU for accelerated data reading.
- **show_dataset_info**: Displays dataset information and visualizes sample slices.
- **print_statistics**: Outputs statistical information about the dataset for analysis.

## Training Scheme for 3D U-Net Model
The training script orchestrates the model's training process, incorporating advanced techniques for optimization and performance enhancement.

### Running the Training Script
#### Environment Setup
- Ensure compatibility with Python 3.x and required libraries.

#### Configuration
- Configure `config.py` with appropriate settings for dataset paths, model parameters, and training configurations.

#### Execution
- Run the training script with the command:
  ```bash
  python train.py
