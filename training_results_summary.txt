Results Summary from train.py
--------------------------------

1. Model Checkpoints and Output:
   - Checkpoints and model outputs are saved in directories based on 'config.exp_name'.
   - Look in the 'samples' and 'results' directories for saved model states and outputs.

2. Logs:
   - Logs related to training progress and metrics might be stored in a 'logs' directory.
   - Specifically, check 'samples/logs' directory, with subdirectories named after 'config.exp_name'.

3. Training Metrics:
   - A summary of training metrics is saved as a JSON file.
   - The file is named like 'training_metrics_{current_date}.json' and should be in the 'results' directory.

Note: The exact directory names depend on the value of 'config.exp_name' set in the training configuration.
